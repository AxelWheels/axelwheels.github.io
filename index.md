## Projects
# Battle Bots (Current work)
[Link](https://github.com/AxelWheels/BattleBots)

Battle Bots was my Game Development project for University but I have taken the project and have decided to rework it to use all the new features of Unity that have been released. This project allows me to explore new features while working towards a final goal.

# Game Behaviour

My work in Game Behaviour involved creating a custom physics engine and also AI that would work within that physics engine. The project was created in Unity for rendering purposes only and uses all custom physics. I was able to add some basic editor gizmos to help illustrate the AI pathing and how it is setup.

# Raytracer

For Graphics 2 in University I created a Raytracer which taught me about the basics of how raytracing works. This currently runs on the cpu which runs very slowly but uses multithreading to speed it up a bit and I have also implemented some basic anti-aliasing by averaging the colour per pixel based on the pixels around it.

# Deadline (Further work planned)
[Link](https://github.com/AxelWheels/Deadline)

This was a very simple project created in my second year of uni, I want to recreate this with a lot of the 2D tools that are now in Unity such as the tilemap tools. I want to make this in to a more presentable project than when it was made previously.
